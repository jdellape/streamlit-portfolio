Big Ten Running Backs,1/2/2022,https://jdellape-big10-running-backs-streamlit-streamlit-app-eu1dlc.streamlitapp.com/,I love Penn State football. I along with the entire fanbase am irritated by the frequency of run plays that go for 2 yards or less. How frequently do our run plays go for 2 yards of less relative to other teams in the conference?,Binned and plotted the running game across multiple BIG 10 teams. Verified that Penn State does have a relatively high frequency of rush plays that go nowhere. Especially when compared to a team like Ohio State. Hopefully they figure it out and the fanbase irritation levels go down.
Fantasy Football Draft Helper,1/23/2022,https://jdellape-streamlit-nfl-app-dceavy.streamlitapp.com/,"My friend said that there was a lack of good resources to see historical fantasy performance of NFL players in an intuitive way for picking a roster during a fantasy draft. Mostly what he was able to find online was simple tables with expert Joe ranks Player A at # 1, Player X at #2. He wanted to collaborate to create a good data app to help with roster selection.",App provides intuitive display of historical fantasy performance by position group. Allows my friend to dynamically slice and dice the data in helpful ways. Used streamlit's incredible user entry objects to allow for actively using the app as part of a real fantasy draft. Examples include indicating which players have already been selected and creating a watch list to drill into comparision charts between specific players you're considering drafting next.
State Park Weather Tracker,4/1/2022,https://jdellape-streamlit-pa-state-park-weather-app-ge148a.streamlitapp.com/,My wife and I like to go hiking every now and then. We typically go to state parks here in Pennsylvania. Sometimes we want to assess which state parks have the least chance of rain for the weekend. My wife was frustrated by how long it would take her to look up the forecasts for different places on weather.com,"Found an API where I could key in lat, lon coordinates and get 7 day forecast for free. My app pulls data that originates from that API and shows the forecasts across all our state parks in a table as well as on a map which highlights which parks have relatively higher / lower chance of rain."
CFB Transfer Portal Tracker,4/28/2022,https://jdellape-streamlit-cfb-transfer-portal-app-ag7sy8.streamlitapp.com/,A lot of now players leave and start with different colleges to play football now. Not a lot of good tools out there to easily see this activity for specific schools.,App allows you to key in your school of interest and view inbound and outbound players over the years via the portal. Would like to enhance this over time to join in performance data to assess impact of transfer portal players on team success.
PR Tracker,6/14/2022,https://jdellape-streamlit-pr-tracker-main-page-1r1dxd.streamlitapp.com/,My wife and I joined a gym. We didn't have a good way to easily submit and track fitness improvement milestones (personal records). ,App has one page with a simple form to submit each time you record a personal record and another page to see historical record of your milestones.
